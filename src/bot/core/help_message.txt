Hi there 👋,  I am <b>Argos</b> 

And I can help you make sure that you never miss an important message in your group chat

Please 🙏 read the description of how the bot works before proceeding

<b>This bot can detect important messages</b>

- Important messages like <b>there is project review next week</b> or <b>we have to submit DA on friday</b> and keep a track of them

<b>You can see these tracked messages</b>

- Using the /show command which will list all the important
messages that the bot detected. 

<b>You can set reminders</b>

<b>by informing the bot about it by giving it the date and time for reminders</b>
Simple words like "next week" or "morning" can be used to inform the bot about date and time

and our <b>Reminder Bot</b> will send a recurring reminder from 
3 days before the deadline

<b>Don't worry, your reminders are private and secure</b>

- The bot encrypts all the messages before storing them 💪

<b>Here is a list of commands:</b>

/start : You can use this function to check if bot is active in your group

/show :  Shows all the important messages that were detected in the coversation

/remind : Reminds you of any events that are scheduled to occur in next 3 days
